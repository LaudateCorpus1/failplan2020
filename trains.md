# FailPlan 2020

This is intended as a (hopefully) more useful set of FAQs for the [RailPlan 2020 problems](https://www.railplan2020.com/timetables). Not affiliated with GTR, obviously.

For the general questions, see the [main page](/).

This page has a some information on specific services based on experience over the last couple of weeks. Obviously it's just best efforts! If you'd like to add something, [email me](mailto:ganesh@earth.li), or if you're familiar with GitHub, send me a [pull request](https://github.com/hsenag/failplan2020).

## Morning peak on the Peterborough line

 - The 0604 from SNO (0542 from PBO, 0556 from HUN, 0614 from BIW) seems to run fairly reliably, sometimes with extra stops. It's busy but not completely overcrowded.
 - The 0628 from SNO is never advertised in advance, but seemed to run most/all days from 4th-15th June. As a result it was also fairly empty. I don't think it ran on Monday 18th June though.
 - The 0659 from SNO is (reportedly) very busy.
 
## Evening peak on the Peterborough line

 - The 1736 from KGX to PBO runs fairly reliably, with extra stops. It's very busy.
 - The 1806 from KGX to PBO is never advertised the day before, but apparently they try to put it back in every day. It didn't run on the 18th.
 - The 1836 from KGX to PBO seems to run fairly reliably, with extra stops making it into a slow service (Finsbury Park, Stevenage, Hitchin, then all stops to Peterborough).
