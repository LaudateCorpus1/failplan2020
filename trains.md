# Information about specific services

This is based on experience over the last couple of weeks. Obviously it's just best efforts!

## Morning peak on the Peterborough line

 - The 0604 from SNO (0542 from PBO, 0556 from HUN, 0614 from BIW) seems to run fairly reliably, sometimes with extra stops. It's busy but not completely overcrowded.
 - The 0628 from SNO is never advertised in advance, but seems to run most/all days. As a result it's also fairly empty.
 - The 0659 from SNO is very busy.
 
## Evening peak on the Peterborough line

 - The 1806 is never advertised the day before, but apparently they try to put it back in every day.
 - The 1836 from KGX to PBO seems to run fairly reliably, with extra stops making it into a slow service (Finsbury Park, Stevenage, Hitchin, then all stops to Peterborough).
