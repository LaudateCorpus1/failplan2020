# FailPlan 2020

This is intended as a (hopefully) more useful set of FAQs for the [RailPlan 2020 problems](https://www.railplan2020.com/timetables). Not affiliated with GTR, obviously.

## Whose fault are the problems?

There's plenty of blame to go around for the initial problems on 20th May and after: Network Rail (who were late with the timetable planning and handing over completed improvements), the Department for Transport (who insisted on a plan that turns out to have been unworkable) and GTR. In the end, GTR are the company being paid to be in the front line, and they didn't raise the alarm even when they knew a few days/weeks in advance that there would be a problem.

Since 20th May, the chaos has been exacerbated by failure to communicate clearly what's actually going on. There's no stable timetable (see below), trains are cancelled or added to the timetable at the last minute, the Twitter team are understaffed and often don't know what's going on anyway. This is entirely GTR's fault.

## Where can I find the current timetable?

You can't. GTR have refused to publish an actual timetable showing what services are and aren't running each day.

Instead they are removing trains from the "planned" timetable (i.e. the one published for 20th May onwards) on an ad hoc basis, either daily or weekly. Then they add back services during the course of each day if they think they can run them. All of this information is *only* available in the online journey planners and the departure boards at stations. Sometimes it doesn't even make it that far.

In practice many trains do seem to run reliably, but the only way to guess at this is to observe what actually happens day to day.

## When will there be an actual timetable?

GTR say they're working towards producing one for July 15th. That would be significantly cut down from the planned May 20th timetable, but if it appears would at least offer some degree of predictability.

## How can I get help quickly?

This is very hit and miss. You can try [Twitter](https://twitter.com/GNRailUK) but they are quite overloaded and mostly don't seem to have access to much more information than is available in the journey planners. You can phone up [customer service on 0345 026 4700](https://www.greatnorthernrail.com/help-and-support/contact-us) but I don't know how useful they would be.

Obviously none of this is the fault of the front-line staff, so please try to keep things as calm as possible and target your frustration at the company and not them personally.

## Who can I complain to?

You can contact customer service by [email](mailto:customerservices@greatnorthernrail.com) or using their [contact form](https://www.greatnorthernrail.com/help-and-support/contact-us). You're unlikely to get anything but a very generic answer unless you are persistent.

There usually seem to be more senior managers around in the evening at Kings Cross, by the platforms 9-11 gateline. They have a bit more information but aren't actually able to fix anything.

There's a ["meet the managers" session](https://www.southernrailway.com/help-and-support/listening-to-you/meet-the-manager) at London Bridge at 7:30-9:30 on Thursday 21st June.

You can also [contact your MP](https://www.writetothem.com/), and/or sign one of the petitions:
